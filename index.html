								The research paper titled "Effects of Hidden Layers on the Efficiency of Neural Networks" investigates the impact of hidden layers on the performance and efficiency of neural networks, particularly in complex problem domains where accuracy and time complexity are crucial factors. The study reviews different approaches and concludes that utilizing three hidden layers tends to offer optimal results in terms of reducing time complexity while maintaining satisfactory accuracy. The paper highlights that architectures with fewer than three hidden layers often experience accuracy loss, while architectures with more than three hidden layers tend to exhibit suboptimal time complexity.
