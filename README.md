When I first learned how to code through an online course back in December of 2021, I went from a completely apathetic student to one who is very interested in optimizing advanced STEM education through technological means. Because of how much extracurricular STEM has changed my life, I wanted to create a centralized place for students to grow in their scientific journies through their own efforts. This is what platstem is about. From free self-learning tools to resources for olympiads, this website provides students with the tools they need to succeed in STEM.
